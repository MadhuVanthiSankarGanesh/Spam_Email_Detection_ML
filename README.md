The google colab notebook attached shows the training and implementation of two models , namely Gaussian NB and LSTM based.
A comparative analysis of these two models, one employing Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and the other utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, reveals that the LSTM model demonstrates significantly more favorable outcomes in comparison to the GNB model.
